#' Converts locus to a data frame
#' 
#' This converts a \code{locus} object into a \code{data.frame} so that
#'  you can use \code{locus} objects in a column of a \code{data.frame}.
#' @param x An object of type \code{code}.  This can be either a single genotype 
#'  (a rare case) or a vector of genotypes (preferred). 
#' @param \dots Additional objects that are passed to \code{as.data.frame.vector}.
#' @return A \code{data.frame} object.
#' @note If you do not assign a data name to the \code{x} in assignment (e.g., 
#'  TPI=x ) it will name the column in the \code{data.frame} the same as the name
#'  of the variable you assigned it.  If this is confusing see the examples.

#' 
#' This function converts loci into data frames consisting of
#'  alleles, stratum, frequencies, etc.
#' @param x Either a vector of types \code{locus} or a \code{data.frame}
#'  containing \code{locus} objects.
#' @param loci The loci to get frquencies from (default is all).
#' @param stratum Partition of the data based upon this stratum
#'  (default is no partitions).
#' @param ... Ignored
#' @return A data frame with Frequencies, Alleles, Loci, and perhaps 
#'  Stratum columns (Allele and Frquencies are at a minimium).
#' @note You can submit RAD-seq genotypes in a normal \code{data.frame} 
#'  to this function BUT it must be formatted as follows.  Each locus
#'  is represented by three columns of probabilities (must sum to 1).
#'  You must label the columns of your data frame with the name of the locus 
#'  and a column number separated by an underscore '_' (e.g., Loc1_1, Loc1_2, 
#'  Loc1_3, Loc2_1, Loc2_2, Loc2_3, etc).  The function will name the locus 
#'  the part before the dash (e.g., Loc1). The frequencies of the heterozygote 
#'  genotype frequency represented in the middle position.

#' 
#' This function is the main one used for estimating genetic diversity among 
#'  stratua.  Given the large number of genetic diversity metrics, not all 
#'  potential types are included.  
#' @param x A \code{data.frame} object with \code{\link{locus}} columns.
#' @param stratum The strata by which the genetic distances are estimated.  This
#'    can be an optional parameter when estimating distance measures calculated
#'    among indiviudals (default='Population'). 
#' @param loci The set of loci to use (default NULL will use all)
#' @param mode The particular genetic diversity metric that you are going to use. 
#'    The \code{gstudio} package currently includes the following individual distance 
#'    measures:
#'    \describe{
#'      \item{A}{Number of alleles}
#'      \item{Ae}{Effective number of alleles (default)}
#'      \item{A95}{Number of alleles with frequency at least five percent}
#'      \item{He}{Expected heterozygosity}
#'      \item{Ho}{Observed heterozygosity}
#'      \item{Hes}{Expected subpopulation heterozygosity (Nei's Corrected)}
#'      \item{Hos}{Expected subpopulation heterozygosity (Nei's Corrected)}
#'      \item{Fis}{Wright's Inbreeding coefficient (size corrected).}
#'      \item{Pe}{Locus polymorphic index.}
#'    }
#' @param small.N Apply small N correction
#' @param ... Other parameters
#' @return A \code{data.frame} with columns for strata, diversity (mode), and potentially P(mode=0).

#' @param mode Whic statistic to estimate.  Current options include:

#' @param nperm The number of permutations used to test the hypothesis that
#'  the parameter = 0.

#'  based upon sample sizes (default=TRUE).

#' Routines used in spatial analysis of genetic marker data
#' 
#' gstudio is a suite of tools used in the spatial analysis
#'  of population genetic data created for the book 
#'  "Applied Landscape Genetics" by R.J. Dyer.   This version
#'  of the package (1.X) is a significant deviant from the 
#'  previous (versions 0.X) resulting from an entire re-write
#'  of the package to maximize ease of use and algorithm quickness.
#'  As such, previous scripts using gstudio (vers. 0.X) will need
#'  to be refactored a bit.  While this can be a bit of a pain, the
#'  larger utility of the new format will pay off in spades.

#' 
#' This function is mostly for simulation work and functions to 
#'  produce a set of offpsring for the individuals passed.
#' @param mom  This is the 'maternal' individual in that all the
#'  metadata in the \code{data.frame} that describes this individual 
#'  will be transfered to the offspring.  
#' @param dad This is the 'paternal' individual and will contribute only
#'  half of its genetic compliement to the offspring.
#' @param N The number of offspring to produce.
#' @return A \code{data.frame} of offspring.
#' @note There are several 'hidden' things in this routine.  First, if you do not
#'  pass a 'dad' object, it will assume you want a selfed offspring.  Second, it 
#'  will by default only make a single offspring.  Next, if you have a column 
#'  labelled "Sex" it will make a random selection of which sex each offspring 
#'  should be and only mate the opposite sexes based upon the levels of the values in
#'  the Sex column.  Finally, if there are columns ID and OffID in the mom, then all 
#'  offspring will have the same ID as the mom but will have OffID equal to 1:N to 
#'  conform with how the functions like \code{paternity()} operate.  If you do not 
#'  have ID and OffID then it will do nothing special.  This can be more than
#'  one individual mom & dad, but if you pass several, they will all have the same
#'  number of offspring (if you only specify a single value of N) or different 
#'  numbers of offspring (if N is passed as a vector and is of length equal to 
#'  that of mom and dad)

#' 
#' This function estimates the allele-wise relatedness statistic from
#'  Lynch & Ritland (1999). It is very sensitive to the presence of 
#'  rare alleles.
#'  
#' This is an symetric estimator using the formula:
#' 
#' \deqn{\hat{r}_{XY} = \frac{r_{XY} + r_{YX}}{2}}
#' 
#' where
#'  
#'  \deqn{r_{XY} = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^L w_i} \sum_{i=1}^L \frac{p_a(\delta_{bc}+\delta_{bd}) + p_b(\delta_{ac} + \delta_{ad}) - 4p_a p_b}{2p_a p_b} }
#'  
#' and 
#' 
#' \deqn{w_i = \frac{((1+\delta_{ab})(p_a+p_b) - 4*p_a p_b)}{2p_a p_b}}
#'  
#' For missing genotypes, relatedness is not estimated for any pair-wise comparison. 
#'  This does not constitute an error, specifically, but you should be careful of 
#'  noting which comparisons are made from no or at least fewer than the full set
#'  of loci.
#' @note For missing data and for data comparing heterozygotes at a 2-allele locus
#'  this estimator is undefined.  
#' @param x A \code{data.frame} or \code{vector} that has \code{locus} objects
#'  in it.  If you pass it a \code{data.frame} it will return the multilocus
#'  relatedness.
