    "contents" : "gstudio 1.1 \n-----------------\n\n* [FIX] Made \"Stratum\" column from make_population() a factor and made the stratum of the resulting population not \"Stratum\" but \"Population\"\n* [FIX] Gst(), Gst_prime(), and Dest() for when a data.frame is passed with only one locus, there is no need to do the multilocus response.  \n* [FIX] Gst(), Gst_prime(), and Dest() for when subset of data is passed (e.g., stratum with zeros counts), the zeros are ignored.\n* [FIX] transition_probability() had an issue with double hets.\n* [FIX] Fixed problem when importing data from text file where you have only one external variable.  \n* [ADD] Added paternity and other items to documentation.\n* [ADD] Added ability to input GenePop files using read_population(file, type=\"genepop\")\n* [ADD] Added pairwise option to genetic_structure() function.\n* [FIX] The function genetic_diversity() did not recognize the 'stratum' option \n* [ADD] Added Fis to genetic_diversity() for continuity.\n* [FIX] A() was not accepting data.frames as it should have been.\n* [FIX] Multilocus estimate of Gst_prime() was wrong if there was a single locus estimate that was negative, in which case the harmonic mean is not correct.\n* [ADD] Added function strata_distance() to return distance matrix between stratum based upon either Euclidean distance or great-circle distance.\n* [ADD] Added function genotype_frequencies() to return both observed and expected frequencies for a given locus.\n* [ADD] Added \", space=\"free\", scales=\"free_x\" to plot_frequencies() for non-overlapping allele counts and better plots.\n* [FIX] Fixed exclusion_probability() to return numeric values for various columns and added multilocus exclusion to result.\n* [FIX] Dataframe column name on multilocus Ho was incorrect\n* [ADD] Changed the transition_probability() function to handle multilocus estimates of both two parent and single parent situations when data are contained in data.frame elements.\n* [FIX] Removed missing data from estimation of genotype_frequencies()\n* [ADD] Added ability for mate() to do replacement random mating (e.g., take all individuals in data.frame and make equal size next generation using complete random mating).\n* [ADD] Added ability to get SpatialPoints object from strata_coordinates() function as well as data.frame.\n* [ADD] Added function optimal_sampling() to help estimate optimal sampling designs for methods requiring estimates of genetic differentiation.\n* [ADD] Added multilocus_diversity() function to return proportion of sample size with unique multilocus genotypes.\n* [ADD] Added geom_locus, geom_frequencies, geom_strata, and geom_surface to plotting functions \n* [ADD] Added function genetic_relatedness() for Ritland 1996 and Lynch & Ritland 1999 marker estimators.\n\n\n* [ADD] Added a migrate() function to aid simulations\n* [ADD] Added option to pass an object of type population_graph to strata_distance() to get distances.\n* [ADD] Changed mate() function to handle within-population mating events if you pass the optional parameter stratum to it.\n\n\ngstudio 1.0 \n-----------------\n\n* This is a complete rewrite of the gstudio (ver. 0.X) package.  What I have done is to remake\n  the fundamental locus object as an S3 object rather than an S4 class. \n* Too much has changed to interate through all of the changes.  To get a good idea of how to \n  use the new functionality see http://dyerlab.github.io/gstudio/\n* Integrated, where possible, spatial connections to both the raster and sp packages such that \n  direct analyses of spatial population genetic processes can be accessed.\n* This first version has the following functional components.\n    - locus(), alleles(), frequencies()\n    - heterozygosity in terms of He(), Fis(), Ho()\n    - genetic_diversity() for parameters Ae(), A(), A95() with rarefaction()\n    - genetic_distance() for dist_amova(), dist_bray(), dist_euclidean(), dist_cgd(), dist_nei(), dist_jaccard(), dist_Dps()\n    - genetic_structure() for Gst(), Gst_prime(), and Dest()\n    - spatial plotting and mapping using sp, raster, and google_maps API's\n    - paternity() with transition_probability() for both strict and fractional paternity.\n    - parent offspring stuff with with minus_mom()\n    - added make_population() and mate() for making random populations\n\n\n",
