gstudio 1.0
-----------------

* This is a complete rewrite of the gstudio (ver. 0.X) package.  What I have done is to remake
  the fundamental locus object as an S3 object rather than an S4 class. As a consequence, all 
  functions have been changed.
* Too much has changed to interate through all of the changes.  To get a good idea of how to 
  use the new functionality see http://dyerlab.github.io/gstudio/
